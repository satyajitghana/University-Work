# DSALab

Well this is my DSALab Repository, you'll find all the lab codes in there.

Here's how it's structured,
    ``000-Data-Structures`` - contains all sorts of common and advanced ADTs
    ``001-Utility-Methods`` - contains input methods an basic common helper methods, also has debugging helpers, more on that later.
    ``xx-<some_lab>`` - these are just my labs, with documentations and codes

Okay now let me tell you why i have those utility methods and data structures. C by default comes with very less support to many sort of data structures that many other languages come with them, and are very easy to use, well it's a little difficult in C isn't it ? unless you are really good at pointers and structures, you should be able to do it pretty easily.

What i tried to do is have all those DataStructures in a different folder and then just include those into my lab programs, i use a Makefile so it's easier to structure them and run them, If you use a IDE, uhh i don't prefer a IDE for C for now atleast, i like plain old VIM with some linters and Makefiles to build and gdb to debug.

Navigate to Data-Structures or UtilityMethods to read it's documentation.
